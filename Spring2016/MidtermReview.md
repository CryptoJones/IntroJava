Midterm Review

Here are some good problems from CodingBat for you to try, as studying for the test (try them with different loops, recursion, etc)
## Ifs

## Loops
+ [StringBits](http://codingbat.com/prob/p165666)
+ [AltPairs](http://codingbat.com/prob/p121596)
+ [StringSplosion](http://codingbat.com/prob/p117334). It would make it easier if you do a function first that gets you a substring (or actually use the substring method of the [String class](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html) )
