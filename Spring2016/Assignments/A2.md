Assignment 2: Simple functions and a full program
===

This is another easy assignment, but now using Eclipse and gradle, and writing a full program.

You will need to create your bitbucket repo first, and upload this assignment inside the a2 folder. You need to make sure to upload to the right place.

The assignment is in [a2.zip](a2.zip). This is a zip file that you need to extract into your projects folder. 

Then you need to modify a2/src/main/java/okaram/a2/A2.java, and make it comply with the specs written with comments. The program also includes a sample.
