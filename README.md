# IntroJava
Materials for an Intro to Programming with java class

This module is actually for two calendar weeks, as there's no class on Monday Jan 18 (and I want to keep online and f2f sections together).
    
## [Module 2](Spring2016/Week2.md) - Full programs and setup

## Module 3 - Conditionals and Recursion

## Other Resources
