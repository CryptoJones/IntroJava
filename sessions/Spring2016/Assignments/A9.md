Assignment 9: Collections
===

This assignment is similar to Assignment 7, but you need to use Lists and Maps instead of an array. This assignment is due Sunday, Apr 17 @ 11:59pm.


You will need to upload this assignment inside the a9 folder of your repo (chances are your repo is still in Documents/projects/cs5000 :). You need to make sure to upload to the right place.

The assignment is in [a9.zip](https://github.com/okaram/IntroJava/raw/master/Spring2016/Assignments/a9.zip). This is a zip file that you need to extract into your projects folder. 

Then you need to modify a9/src/main/java/assignment/Assignment9.java, and make it comply with the specs written with comments. This assignment is slightly different, in that you need to define two classes; since those classes don't yet exist, my unit tests won't even compile ! you can type `./gradlew run -x test` to run my program.

I am providing test cases for all functions and required classes; you can use ./gradlew test to run all tests (or run in Eclipse). You can also run ./gradlew grade to get an idea of your grade (I still look at the code). 


There's no requirement for main, you can use as you see fit.

Submit by updating your bitbucket repository.

# downloading and submitting

I am assuming you've followed the instructions in [Repo setup](../RepoSetup.md) for last week's assignment, so you have your ~/Documents/projects/cs5000 folder

## go to class folder
Type:
```
cd ~/Documents/projects/cs5000
```
to go your class folder

## download file (you need to do this only once per assignment)

Then type:
```
curl -o a9.zip "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okaram/IntroJava/master/Spring2016/Assignments/a9.zip"
```
to download the assignment folder as a zip file

Then:
```
unzip a9.zip
```

To unzip the file

# build etc

Type:
```
cd a9
```
to go to the assignment folder 

## create eclipse project

If you will be using eclipse, type
```
./gradlew eclipse
```
to create the eclipse project.

For this assignment, stary by Typing:
```
./gradlew run -x test
```

Notice that initially, you cannot build with gradle, since the tests won't even compile (they use classes that are not defined, since you need to define those :)

After you've defined Square and RegularPolygon then you can do
```
./gradlew grade
```
for automatic grading (I'm not grading your main function with this, but I am grading the other ones somewhat automatically; I still read your code, of course :)

## modify in eclipse

Import project in eclipse (import existing project), modify src/main/java/okaram/assignment/Assignment9.java until you're happy.

# upload to repo

When you're done (or done for the day; I tend to use bitbucket also as a backup :)

```
git add .
git commit -m "...."
git push origin master
```
