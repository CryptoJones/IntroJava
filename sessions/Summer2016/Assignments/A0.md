Assignment 0 - Sample
===

Remember, the first thing to do is to GET YOUR BITBUCKET account, and let me know immediately, so you can work on the assignment. 

Assignments are submitted by pull-request, to a repo I create for you. After you tell me your bitbucket username, then I will send you an email with your repo, and instructions.

This assumes you have created a projects folder on your Documents folder, and cloned your repo to it.

## Going to your folder
Open your git-bash console, and type:
```cd ~/Documents/projects```

## Create a new branch, called a0
```
git checkout -b a0
```

Notice after you have created the branch, you should do ```git checkout a0``` without the -b. ```git status``` shows you which branch you are on, and ```git branch``` shows which branches are available.



This assignment is for practice and will not be graded; however, you need to do this before attempting assignment 1. This assignment is due Wednesday, June 8 @ 6:00 pm.
