Assignment 0 - Sample
===

Remember, the first thing to do is to GET YOUR BITBUCKET account, and let me know immediately, so you can work on the assignment. 

Assignments are submitted by pull-request, to a repo I create for you. After you tell me your bitbucket username, then I will send you an email with your repo, and instructions.

This assumes you have created a projects folder on your Documents folder, and cloned your repo to it.

## Going to your folder
Open your git-bash console, and type:
```cd ~/Documents/projects```

## Create a new branch, called a0
```
git checkout -b a0
```

Notice after you have created the branch, you should do ```git checkout a0``` without the -b. ```git status``` shows you which branch you are on, and ```git branch``` shows which branches are available.

## Run tests

I provide unit tests that check your assignment works; you will normally start by running these tests and seeing them fail, and continuosly implement pieces of functionality and running the tests again; if it all works, you should pass more tests each time.

You can run the tests two different ways; using [gradle](http://gradle.org), an automated build system, or using [eclipse](http://eclipse.org), an Integrated Development Environment.

To start, run ```./gradlew test``` to run all unit tests. You will see a bunch of messages, including some about tests failing.

You can also run ```./gradlew grade``` which will give you an idea about your possible grade.

## Run tests with eclipse

This assignment is for practice and will not be graded; however, you need to do this before attempting assignment 1. This assignment is due Wednesday, June 8 @ 6:00 pm.
