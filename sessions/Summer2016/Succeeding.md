Succeeding in this class
===

This class is planned so that, even if you've never programmed before, you will succeed and become a (beginner) programmer; of course, any experience with programming and things that are like programming (html development, writing bat files, using the command line a lot in a Unix system) will help.

## Time requirements

This is an 8-week Summer class, and so it is twice as fast as our regular classes; you should plan to spend about 20 hours a week in this class; and the variance, both within students and week to week, may be quite high; you may need to spend 25 or even 30 hours one week, although you should not need to spend that much every week.

## Succeeding

+ **start early** that way, you can find out whether you need to spend more time, or you can ask for help and get it, so you don't fall behind.
+ **ask for help** if and when you need it; we will have discussion groups where you can ask; also, ask the teacher directly, either by email or with comments on your pull request.
+ **embrace the technology** make sure you can use the technology; if your computer gets misconfigured, fix it before continuing; although code is text, and you could do it in any system, we have built a lot of scaffolding to help you.
+ **embrace unit tests** in particular; use unit tests to guide your assignments; run them often, as they give you immediate feedback; if you can't run them, fix it first, rather than trying to program blind.
