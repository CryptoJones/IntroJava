## Free textbooks
* [Think Java](http://greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/)
* [Javanotes](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/), another free textbook.
* [Intro to Programming in Java](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/). From Princeton, not a full book.
* [Thinking in Java](http://www.mindviewinc.com/Books/TIJ4/), by Bruce Eckel; a great book, although not necessarily designed for beginners. You can get previous editions for free, and the first few chapters of the newest edition. 
* [The Java tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) From Oracle; covers most of the language, but it is not necessarily for begginers. Web site, and you can buy the actual book.
