## Comments

Comments can help clarify your code and, especially at the beginning, are very useful when you are writing programs (although as a professional programmer you would probably write less comments than now).

In Java, we can use /* this comment style */, where anything between the /* and */ is a comment; we also can use // to comment until the end of the line.
```java

/* this is a comment */

int a; // this is a comment 
```
