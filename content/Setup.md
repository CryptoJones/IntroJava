Required Setup
===

These instructions are written for Windows (and tested on a Windows 10 machine). Please ask if you're using a different OS.

For the first couple of weeks we will use web applications instead of requiring you to install software, giving you a little time to install everything. It is OK to feel stressed, as you need to install several things, and the instructions cannot be perfect since we don't know which specific versions of things you get; take a deap breath .... and anohter ... and ask if you need help (both in D2L and directly emailing me).

# Installing a git client

We will use BitBucket as our code repository, but you still need a
