Using Objects
===

We have now used String objects, but haven't looked at all the things we can normally do with objects. Here we will show the things we can do, and practice some examples.

## Things we can do with objects
+ Create them - new
+ Access public instance variables
    + Read
    + Write
+ Access public methods
+ Assign
+ Compare (references)

## Example: java.awt.Point

## Example: java.awt.Rectangle
