Defining our own classes
===

In Java, we can define our own classes, our own datatypes; if we create the right classes, which correspond to our problem domain, we can then express our problem in natural terms. Creating classes is like creating our own vocabulary (and closer to English and Writing than to math, which makes it really hard:).

## File names and naming conventions
In Java, public classes should be in a file with the same name as the class; so if you have a class named Person, it should be in a file named Person.java (and, although gradle will do magic, it should be in a folder structure that follows the package naming; so if your class' full name is kennesaw.assignment.Person, it should be in a file with path kennesaw/assignment/Person.java, or, following gradle's convention, src/main/kennesaw/assignment/Person.java).
