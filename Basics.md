Programming Basics
===

You program in a **Programming Language** (which looks somewhat like English), but computers only understand **machine language**; you need a **compiler**, which translates the program into machine language. Since each different kind of computer has its own machine language, Java (as many other technologies) uses a **virtual machine**.
